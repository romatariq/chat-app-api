# TODOs

- [X] Username displayed as case sensitive but unique as not case sensitive (e.g. Admin == admin)
- [X] Add filters to username ([a-z], [A-Z], [0-9], _, -)
- [ ] Add email confirmation (mvc?, not just link but also has to click a button)
- [X] Remove hard coded admin info (id, password)
- [X] Add paging (verificationController getAll)
- [ ] Add external (google) login, maybe even remove own register to avoid implementing email confirmation etc.
- [ ] Remove verify user controller, no reason for it
- [ ] Add hard coded admin id for dev (so cookies wouldn't display userId that doesn't exist)

- [ ] Fix all TODOs
