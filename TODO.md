# TODOs

- [X] Username displayed as case sensitive but unique as not case sensitive (e.g. Admin == admin)
- [X] Add filters to username ([a-z], [A-Z], [0-9], _, -)
- [X] Remove hard coded admin info (id, password)
- [X] Add paging (verificationController getAll)
- [X] Remove verify user controller, no reason for it
- [X] Add hard coded admin id for dev (so cookies wouldn't display userId that doesn't exist)
